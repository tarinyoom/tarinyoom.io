Welcome to my dev journal!

I started this journal as a replacement for my personal site to better document my personal journey as a developer.
While it's fun to write code and build functionality, it's easy to get lost in the weeds and forget about the motivations for writing that code and the outcome of building that functionality.

This journal is my approach for reflecting and ensuring that my actions priorities make sense from a bird's-eye view.
